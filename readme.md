## Platformer

A simpel 2D platform sample game made with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). An
Android version of the game is available on [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mtdeer.platformer2d)

The origin of this project is available [here](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/master/2d/platformer).

The game itself is not complete but just a sample game to show how to use Godot
game engine and the [Godot AdMob module](https://github.com/kloder-games/godot-admob)
to create an Android game with [AdMob](https://apps.admob.com/v2/home) support
for ads.
